\chapter{Generating Test Cases from Graph Processes}\label{ch:tests}

Given a grammar representing an Use Case extracted according to the methodology presented in \cite{Junior2015} with:

\begin{itemize}
\item set of steps (rules)
\item set of sequences
\item in and out relations
\end{itemize}

We want to generate:

\begin{itemize}
\item conflict relation between the rules, presenting the conflict items and the type of the conflict.
\item dependency relation between the rules, presenting the dependency items as well as the type of the dependency.
\end{itemize}
