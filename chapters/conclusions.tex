\section{Future Work}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Investigate Conflicts, Dependencies and Local Church-Rosser with Graph Constraints
  \item NACs over concrete elements of the core graph and not only over the type graph. 
  \item Compile general NACs to incremental NACs
  \item Investigate whether there are a better algorithm than backtracking to compute occurrence relations
  \item GUI for presenting Doubly-Typed Graph Grammars
\end{itemize}
