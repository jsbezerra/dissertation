\chapter{Conclusions}\label{ch:conclusions}

This thesis has the following major contributions:

\begin{itemize}
  \item extension of the framework of occurrence graph grammars to deal with negative application conditions
  \item the implementation of the calculation of occurrence graph grammars from graph grammars on verigraph
  \item the use of occurrence graph grammars and its relations to generate test cases, also using verigraph.
\end{itemize}

and collateral contributions:

\begin{itemize}
\item the implementation of a generic architecture for basic categorial operations, which can be used by different category implementations with relatively little effort.
\end{itemize}

\section{Future Work}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Investigate Conflicts, Dependencies and Local Church-Rosser with Graph Constraints
  \item NACs over concrete elements of the core graph and not only over the type graph. 
  \item Compile general NACs to incremental NACs
  \item Investigate whether there are a better algorithm than backtracking to compute occurrence relations
  \item GUI for presenting Doubly-Typed Graph Grammars
\end{itemize}
