There exists a wide range of model-based techniques to test generation~\cite{Utting2006}, however due to the scope of our work we will focus on those based on graph transformation systems.

The advantages of graph transformation systems over other models are...

In \cite{Baldan2004}, the unfolding of graph transformation systems is used to generate test cases for code generators.
